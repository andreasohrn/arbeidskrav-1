	abstract = {The aim of this study is to estimate the ratio of male and female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research. Original research articles published in three major Sports and Exercise Medicine journals (Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, British Journal of Sports Medicine and American Journal of Sports Medicine) over a three-year period were examined. Each article was screened to determine the following: total number of participants, the number of female participants and the number of male participants. The percentage of females and males per article in each of the journals was also calculated. Cross tabulations and Chi-square analysis were used to compare the gender representation of participants within each of the journals. Data were extracted from 1382 articles involving a total of 6,076,580 participants. A total of 2,366,968 (39\%) participants were female and 3,709,612 (61\%) were male. The average percentage of female participants per article across the journals ranged from 35\% to 37\%. Females were significantly under-represented across all of the journals (χ2 = 23,566, df = 2, p {\textless} 0.00001). In conclusion, Sports and Exercise Medicine practitioners should be cognisant of sexual dimorphism and gender disparity in the current literature.},

	abstract = {Until recently, there has been less demand for and interest in female-specific sport and exercise science data. As a result, the vast majority of high-quality sport and exercise science data have been derived from studies with men as participants, which reduces the application of these data due to the known physiological differences between the sexes, specifically with regard to reproductive endocrinology. Furthermore, a shortage of specialist knowledge on female physiology in the sport science community, coupled with a reluctance to effectively adapt experimental designs to incorporate female-specific considerations, such as the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptive use, pregnancy and the menopause, has slowed the pursuit of knowledge in this field of research. In addition, a lack of agreement on the terminology and methodological approaches (i.e., gold-standard techniques) used within this research area has further hindered the ability of researchers to adequately develop evidenced-based guidelines for female exercisers. The purpose of this paper was to highlight the specific considerations needed when employing women (i.e., from athletes to non-athletes) as participants in sport and exercise science-based research. These considerations relate to participant selection criteria and adaptations for experimental design and address the diversity and complexities associated with female reproductive endocrinology across the lifespan. This statement intends to promote an increase in the inclusion of women as participants in studies related to sport and exercise science and an enhanced execution of these studies resulting in more high-quality female-specific data.},

	abstract = {Physiological Tests for Elite Athletes, Second Edition, presents the most current protocols used for assessing high-level athletes. Based on the insight and experience of sport scientists who work closely with elite athletes to optimize sporting success, this comprehensive guide offers the how and why of both general and sport-specific physiological testing procedures. Readers will learn to use these tests to identify the strengths and weaknesses of athletes, monitor progress, provide feedback, and enhance performance their athletes' potential. Physiological Tests for Elite Athletes, Second Edition, guides readers in ensuring precision and reliability of testing procedures in the field or lab; correctly preparing athletes before testing; and accurately collecting, handling, and analyzing data. It leads readers through general testing concepts and athlete monitoring tools for determining anaerobic capacity, neuromuscular power, blood lactate thresholds, and VO2max. It also presents principles and protocols for common lab- and field-based assessments of body composition, agility, strength and power, and perceptual and decision-making capabilities. Reproducible forms throughout the book assist readers with data collection and preparticipation screening. After reviewing general protocols, this unique text takes a sport-specific look at the most effective tests and their applications in enhancing the performance of elite athletes. Protocols for 18 internationally recognized sports are introduced, and for each sport a rationale for the tests, lists of necessary equipment, and detailed testing procedures are provided. Normative data collected from athletes competing at national and international levels serve as excellent reference points for measuring elite athletes. New to the second edition are sport-specific assessments for Australian football, BMX cycling, rugby, sprint kayaking, high-performance walking, and indoor and beach volleyball. The second edition of Physiological Tests for Elite Athletes also features other enhancements, including extensive updates to normative data and reference material as well as several new chapters. New information on data collection and handling covers approaches for analyzing data from the physiological monitoring of individual athletes and for groups of athletes in team sports. Revised chapters on environmental physiology provide current insights regarding altitude training and training in heat and humidity. Discussions of the scientific basis of various strategies for athlete recovery in both training and competition enable readers to make sound decisions in employing those strategies to help their athletes optimally recover. For exercise physiologists, coaches, and exercise physiology students, Physiological Tests for Elite Athletes, Second Edition, is the essential guide to the most effective assessment protocols available. Using the precise and proven protocols in this authoritative resource, exercise physiologists can acquire detailed information to assist athletes' preparation.},

	abstract = {The fight against doping in sport is internationally coordinated by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Through its World Anti-Doping Code, WADA aims to harmonize anti-doping policies, rules and regulations. One key reference document bound to the Code is the International Standard for Laboratories (ISL), which mainly specifies the criteria that must be met for laboratory accreditation, as well as standards to adopt for the production of valid test results and evidentiary data. Within the ISL, the Code of Ethics refers to the Helsinki Declaration as a guiding framework for anti-doping research. However, inasmuch as anti-doping research structurally differs from human subject research as considered by the Helsinki Declaration, the applicability of the latter to anti-doping research can be called into question. In this work, we discuss how key principles of the Helsinki Declaration apply to anti-doping research and highlight frictions, incompatibilities and misalignments. Furthermore, we indicate possible solutions for operationalizing the Helsinki principles within the context of anti-doping research.},

Resistance training for older adults: position statement from the national strength and conditioning association. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000–000, 2019—Aging, even in the absence of chronic disease, is associated with a variety of biological changes that can contribute to decreases in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function. Such losses decrease physiologic resilience and increase vulnerability to catastrophic events. As such, strategies for both prevention and treatment are necessary for the health and well-being of older adults. The purpose of this Position Statement is to provide an overview of the current and relevant literature and provide evidence-based recommendations for resistance training for older adults. As presented in this Position Statement, current research has demonstrated that countering muscle disuse through resistance training is a powerful intervention to combat the loss of muscle strength and muscle mass, physiological vulnerability, and their debilitating consequences on physical functioning, mobility, independence, chronic disease management, psychological well-being, quality of life, and healthy life expectancy. This Position Statement provides evidence to support recommendations for successful resistance training in older adults related to 4 parts: (a) program design variables, (b) physiological adaptations, (c) functional benefits, and (d) considerations for frailty, sarcopenia, and other chronic conditions. The goal of this Position Statement is to a) help foster a more unified and holistic approach to resistance training for older adults, b) promote the health and functional benefits of resistance training for older adults, and c) prevent or minimize fears and other barriers to implementation of resistance training programs for older adults.},

	abstract = {Internal validity refers to the degree of control exerted over potential confounding variables to reduce alternative explanations for the effects of various treatments. In exercise and sports-science research and routine testing, internal validity is commonly achieved by controlling variables such as exercise and warm-up protocols, prior training, nutritional intake before testing, ambient temperature, time of testing, hours of sleep, age, and gender. However, a number of other potential confounding variables often do not receive adequate attention in sports physiology and performance research. These confounding variables include instructions on how to perform the test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room, influence of music played before and during testing, and the effects of mental fatigue on performance. In this review the authors discuss these variables in relation to common testing environments in exercise and sports science and present some recommendations with the goal of reducing possible threats to internal validity.},
